          <p>Welcome to Assemble!</p>
          <p>Designed at the outset for role-playing system designers, Assemble is a content-authorship tool which allows for RPG designers to plan and write <i>Powered by the Apocalypse</i> (PbtA) systems.</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Powered by the Apocalypse</summary>
            <img src="images/pbta.png" alt="Powered by the Apocalypse" title="Powered by the Apocalypse">
            <p>Assemble has been specifically designed to work best for <i>Powered by the Apocalypse</i> systems.  Though <i>Powered by the Apocalypse</i> is generally considered a loose grouping (essentially defined by any system that takes inspiration from <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/"><i>Apocalypse World</i></a>, designed by Vincent and Meguey Baker) there are certain elements that most PbtA systems tend to have in common:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The GM, or game master, is commonly referred to instead as the Master of Ceremonies (MC)</li>
              <li>Action is based around the use of "moves", which a system pre-defines for its players.</li>
              <li>To decide the outcome of most moves, two six-sided dice are rolled and applicable modifiers are added.</li>
              <li>Outcomes are either hit or miss; a roll of six or less is considered a miss, and a roll of seven or above is a hit.</li>
              <li>Hits are often further divided into successes (10+) and partial successes (7-9).</li>
              <li>Finally, classes are defined by single-sheet "playbooks", commonly designed for quick character setup, doubling as both a reference document and a character sheet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beyond <i>Apocalypse World</i>, other examples of <i>Powered by the Apocalypse</i> systems include <i>Monsterhearts</i>, <i>Dungeon World</i>, <i>Bluebeard's Bride</i>, and others.  For more information on <i>Powered by the Apocalypse</i> systems, please visit the <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta/">Powered by the Apocalypse website</a>.</p>

            <summary>Assemble Basics</summary>
            <p>To simulate and visualize the construction of a standard PbtA system, Assemble utilizes a pattern language: a set of discrete fields that form an accepted system once they are filled out and iterated upon to the designer's liking.  Designers employ pattern languages as a utility to show them which design options are at their disposal, to assist in laying out an effective, cohesive system blueprint.  Patterns may be represented by text fields, checkboxes, dropdown menus, block inputs, or even blocks themselves:</p>
            <img src="images/patterns.png" alt="Setting blocks with outlines" title="Each box indicates one of several types of patterns that can be resolved.">
            <p class="caption">Each box indicates one of several types of patterns that can be resolved.</p>
            <p>These patterns function together to lay out a plan for organizing system elements that the designer can then fill in as necessary. Note that <i>not every pattern needs to be resolved</i>; rather, the pattern language should serve as a workflow to help the designer consider how their system might fulfill certain design criteria, whilst sticking to the designer's own goals.</p>
            <p>Assemble operates with the help of the Blockly editor.  To add a block to the system, simply select the category of the toolbox where the block is located,</p>
            <img src="images/step1.png" alt="Open toolbox" title="Open the toolbox.">
            <p>drag out the block,</p>
            <img src="images/step2.png" alt="Drag block outside toolbox" title="Drag the block outside of the toolbox.">
            <p>and connect the block to its place in the block tree.</p>
            <img src="images/step3.png" alt="Connect block" title="Connect the block.">
            <p>Any block with a notch below it can be connected to additional blocks of the same type, and you are able to use as many or as few blocks as you need to craft your system as you wish.</p>
            <p>You can export your Assemble project as an XML file by clicking <b>Export Blocks</b> at the bottom right corner of the page.  You can also import other systems made in Assemble with the <b>Import Blocks</b> button.  (Warning: Imports will delete your current workspace, so make sure you've saved everything first.)</p>
            <p>Assemble separates role-playing systems into three distinct categories: <b>Themes</b>, <b>Setting</b>, and <b>Mechanics</b>.  The rest of this page will describe the blocks in each of these categories, where those blocks can be found and placed, and the role each block plays within the system as a whole.  For quick information about a particular block, you can also mouse over any block for a brief summary on how to use it.  To see these blocks in action, check out the blocks entered into the <b>Examples</b> headings in the toolbox.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Themes</summary>
            <p>This section describes themes and their functions, both of which are located under the <b>System</b> heading of the toolbox.  They are connected to the Themes input of the System block.</p>
            <img src="images/theme.png" alt="Theme and function blocks" title="Theme and function blocks.">
            <p><b>Themes</b> can be loosely described as the overarching principles which drive the tone of a system's narrative and play.  They may take the form of a genre (e.g. horror, detective fiction, sci-fi), a particular role-playing style (e.g. MC-less, player competition, modular), or an interesting story prompt (e.g. historical figures transported into a modern setting, dragons assuming the roles of adventurers, mall clerks having to fend off a zombie invasion).  Identifying an underlying theme (or themes) to design a system around can be an important consideration when crafting a role-playing system that is captivating for players.  Ensuring that the look and feel of your system is recognizable and unique is a major responsibility of effective theming. Themes are also useful for maintaining harmony between your system's individual elements; generally your system's parts should serve its overall themes and design philosophy wherever possible.</p>
            <p><b>Functions</b> are more low-level realizations of themes. They describe how a theme contributes to certain aspects of the game's design.  For example, perhaps a theme of suspense has a function of red herrings being common in the story to throw off the players, or a function of rising action playing a role in how moves are made in the game.  Functions may also operate on a more meta level; a modular theme could simply have the function of making play more intuitive or streamlining setup.  Whatever your theme is, that theme should always have a precise direction for how it will impact the look and feel of your system.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Setting</summary>
            <p>This section describes blocks in the <b>Setting</b> heading of the toolbox.  They are connected to the Setting input of the System block.</p>
            <img src="images/setting.png" alt="Setting block" title="A setting block.">
            <p>A <b>setting</b> is a fictional space in which a system's narrative is set. If it helps set the stage for the story, or builds the world of the system, it should go in here.  If you want to define more settings for your system, you can do so by adding additional Setting blocks.</p>
            <p><b>Societies</b> are groups of people that can be encountered within the setting, whether united by blood, creed, community, or otherwise.</p>
            <p>A <b>history</b> is an account of past events, however recent those events may be.  Different subjects will have different histories.  The same subject might even have different histories, depending on whose account is being considered.</p>
            <p>Each History block is defined by three additional types of blocks: eras, entities, and events.  <b>Eras</b> describe historical periods in which stories are set, specifying what age of human history they may be analogous to, and how far back known history might reach in a given setting.  <b>Entities</b> are figures (whether they be humans, groups, or otherwise) that have left some impact on a story's world, or perhaps are currently active within it.  <b>Events</b> are past occurrences that are relevant for the players, providing greater context for the world as it may currently exist.</p>
            <p>A <b>mystery</b> is, in essence, a hint to something greater.  It represents information that is not known to the players, and usually not even the MC.  A mystery should be thought of as a kind of question, to be answered over the course of a game's campaign.  Give the players an interesting enigma to ponder, and provide the MC with a basis to get their story-bending juices flowing.  Avoid giving your own answers wherever possible.</p>
            <img src="images/region.png" alt="Region and landmark blocks" title="Region and landmark blocks.">
            <p>A <b>region</b> is a relevant location within the setting.  It can simply include a basic description of the general surroundings, or it can be expanded to include landmarks.</p>
            <p><b>Landmarks</b> are defined geographical features, buildings, and points of interest within a region, to give that region more flavor.  Defining more landmarks in a given region might give your system's MC more to work with when planning their story.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Mechanics</summary>
            <p>Mechanics are where things get a little more complicated.  The blocks related to system mechanics are each divided into the five remaining headings of the toolbox.  You can also access the default player rules pattern from the System block.  Please note that a system can only hold one player rules block at a time.</p>
            <details>
              <summary class="inner">Moves</summary>
              <p>The Moves heading is arguably the most important area of mechanics design for PbtA systems.  In this section, you will need to add the moves that are actionable by players, as well as their building blocks.</p>
              <img src="images/move.png" alt="A move block" title="A move block.">
              <p>A <b>move</b> is any action that a player can take which is specified by the system.  A move should have a name, an effect (a short summary of what it should be used for), a group of factors ordered by their sequential relevance in the move itself, and a detailed description of how the move is executed within the system's rules.</p>
              <img src="images/factor.png" alt="A factor block" title="A factor block.">
              <p>Before building a move, you will need to construct the relevant factor blocks.  A <b>factor</b> is any metric that affects the move's action until it is resolved.  It might be a stat that is relevant to the move, an operation (like making a choice or asking a question) that affects the move's outcome while it is being made, or any operation that plays a role in how the move itself is carried out.  A factor can have one of four types: Scalar (has a positive or negative value that is directly combined with a roll), Reroll (calls for the repeat of a previous action or a re-rolling of the dice), Revision (gives an immediate response or ignores a different factor, move, or roll), or Meta (originates from story or gameplay rather than a rigid mechanic).  Some factors can also originate as the result of certain moves; these factors should be marked as a Result to be tracked as such.</p>
              <p>Once you've filled out some factor blocks and connected them to the "Move Factors" input of the Mechanics block, the dropdown menu under the "Factors" section of the move block will populate with the names of those factors, allowing you to select them and add them to the block.  You can then continue adding as many factors as necessary.  If a move results in any factors, select the "Result Factor(s)" checkbox, and you will be able to add any number of relevant result factors in a similar manner.</p>
              <img src="images/parameter.png" alt="A parameter block" title="A parameter block.">
              <p>If your move's outcome is based on parameters outside of the standard ones used for PbtA systems (success, partial success, and so on; see "Powered by the Apocalypse" above for details), you can specify those parameters with <b>parameter</b> blocks.  If your system uses special parameters, check the box labeled "special parameters" on the Mechanics block and insert your parameter blocks as needed.  Make sure that the "range" fields encompass a valid range of potential roll outcomes.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary class="inner">Playbooks</summary>
              <img src="images/playbook.png" alt="Playbook, introduction, and feature blocks" title="Playbook, introduction, and feature blocks.">
              <p><b>Playbooks</b> are the player classes of a <i>Powered by the Apocalypse</i> system; each playbook represents a certain personality or skill set for the character using it.  The more playbooks a system has, the more options a player will have to choose from when deciding what character to play as.</p>
              <p>A playbook should have some kind of <b>introduction</b> to help players learn about its general play-style and personality.  This introduction can include a flavor pitch describing the playbook in the context of the system's world, a description of the playbook's social role, a summary of its mechanical role, or some combination of the three.</p>
              <p>Playbooks should also contain a list of special features and/or moves at that playbook's disposal.  <b>Playbook moves</b> are functionally identical to regular moves, but instead can only be applied to playbooks.  <b>Playbook features</b>, on the other hand, describe passive attributes that a playbook has without constituting moves of their own.  Like moves, they can affect or be affected by a set of relevant factors.  Both playbook features and playbook moves can be connected to the "Moves/Features" section of the Playbook block.</p>
              <p>Playbooks can also have resources that aren't shared by all playbooks (for more information on resources, read "Management" below).</p>
              <p>Finally, playbooks can come with a set of options for starting items that they can choose from.  To use the dropdown menu here, the system must first have some items defined (see "Equipment" for details).  The process of choosing equipment should also be specified within the playbook's creation rules (see "Management" for details).</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary class="inner">Management</summary>
              <img src="images/character.png" alt="Character creation, character improvement, and step blocks" title="Character creation, character improvement, and step blocks.">
              <p>The Management heading of the toolbox contains blocks for character creation, character improvement, steps, and playbook steps.  <b>Character creation</b> and <b>character improvement</b> specify the rules for creating new characters, and improving (i.e, leveling up) existing ones, respectively.  Each block breaks down the process into <b>steps</b>, each of which lays out a specific stage in the process of developing a character.</p>
              <p>Playbooks may also have processes for creation and improvement that are unique from other playbooks.  To specify playbook-specific creation or improvement processes, place a <b>playbook step</b> block (labeled "Steps for: &lt;playbook&gt;") under either "Playbook Creation Rules" or "Playbook Improvement Rules", label it with the appropriate playbook, and add the playbook-specific steps into that block instead.</p>
              <p>The character improvement block also allows you to specify the conditions necessary for a character to improve (such as reaching a certain level of XP, or completing a certain task).  Conditions can be universal to all characters, specific to certain playbooks, or work as a mixture of the two.  If you need to enter playbook-specific conditions for improvement, check the box labeled "Playbook Conditions" and place <b>condition</b> blocks into the relevant input:</p>
              <img src="images/condition.png" alt="A condition block" title="A condition block.">
              <p>When using condition blocks, be sure to specify the playbook they apply to in addition to the conditions for that playbook's improvement.</p>
              <img src="images/resource.png" alt="A resource block" title="A resource block.">
              <p>Also located under the Management heading are resource blocks.  <b>Resources</b> are values that are maintained as part of a character's information.  Resources can be ability stats, health values, currency, or any other value that the players should keep track of over the course of play.  Resources are also tied to factors, though in this case, these factors are mostly intended to represent the metrics which are dependent on each resource, rather than the other way around (for more information on factors, see the "Moves" section for details).  Resources can either be universal for all player characters (placed in the "Resources" section of the player rules block) or unique to certain playbooks (placed in the relevant playbook blocks that use them).</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary class="inner">Equipment</summary>
              <img src="images/equipment.png" alt="Equipment, type, and item blocks" title="Equipment, type, and item blocks.">
              <p><b>Equipment</b> is comprised of the system-defined objects, weapons, and artifacts that players can use.  Equipment is divided into two lists of blocks: equipment types and items.</p>
              <p><b>Equipment types</b> describe a certain category of items.  Items that have a given type will have all the properties of that type, indicated by its factors (for more information on factors, see the "Moves" section for details).  Types can also have subtypes, which have all the factors of the parent type, as well as additional factors that make that subtype more unique.  Some types and subtypes may not need factors, but can still be useful to identify for clarity.</p>
              <p><b>Items</b> are the individual tools and objects that characters in the system can utilize for their purposes.  Once you have entered some types into the "Equipment Types" section, you will be able to select an item's types via the "Types" dropdown menu.  Once you have selected one or more types, those types' subtypes will appear in the "Subtypes" dropdown menu as well.  Feel free to add as many types and subtypes to each item as are relevant.</p>
              <p>Once you have added items to the system, you can specify any of those items as starting items for playbooks (see "Playbooks" for details).</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary class="inner">Extra Mechanics</summary>
              <img src="images/extra.png" alt="An extra mechanic block" title="An extra mechanic block.">
              <p>If your system has any extra quirks or elements that you don't feel are accurately covered by the existing blocks in Assemble, then you can specify those elements with <b>extra mechanics</b> blocks.  These blocks contain fields for relevant factors, moves, and resources to be added as necessary.  Mark the "Extra Mechanics" box of the Player Rules block to add them into the system.</p>
              <p>For more information on factors, see the "Moves" section for details.</p>

When queer attraction proves to be unrequited, additional tensions are thrown into the mix: the fear of being outed, the risk of gay panic, the resentment of “but you’re literally the only other dyke in town, how can you do this to me?” Working with queer assumptions means putting more opportunities and more risks on the table, giving you a wider range of potential stories with the same number of characters.</field>

Is your character flunking their classes? Does your character come from a split family? Are they pretty? Is their family wealthy or are they living off food stamps? Is their dad in jail?

It’s just what our parents built sinking out from under us. What we thought would support us. The world we could depend on, disappearing. Economically, most of the lumber mills have shut down. Allswell’s been trying to reinvent itself but the experiments have been sluggish and unimaginative. Zoning never changes which gradually creates more problems, plus the housing shortage. Poorer families rent on the lip, but many whose dream homes are there haven’t left them. Businesses fall in &amp; then don’t exist anymore. People talk about the excellent halal restaurant we used to have. What don’t we know we’re missing?</field>

              <field name="desc">This town is all about tourism and the shimmer and shadows of performance. Most nights are filled with the light and laughter of talented rogues that wander the streets for tips and adventure. So many inhabitants dream of becoming one in the lights. Those that can’t cut it make do with the more attainable glamour found in the market or the wildness found on the shores by the sea. The economy relies heavily on the market, the supernaturally talented street performers, the tourism derived from them, and the compensation from their crowds as easy-pickings for the bird-shaped shadow that stalks folks in the dark of the... day? The town also boasts world-class conservation of their waterfalls (anybody hear that hissing in the night? whose bones are those?), a sanctuary to the endangered dove, and that landfill fire that still hasn’t gone out. Through fires, feathers, salt water, and spice... this is a lush place that also manages to be gritty, burning and sharp. Its magic is fading, possibly because of the many deaths of the island’s beloved scrappy dove (spirits). Maybe it’s only changing because the time of the tricksy bateleur family has finally come. Either way, when you’re kicking back at the beach and showing off, you’ll probably not want to wander too far off the coast... There’s a hungry perimeter of sea ghosts held back only by the dubious intentions of the underwater sculpture garden.</field>

Guys with beards, thick-rimmed glasses and no business experience whatsoever are going public on Wall Street for profits that should have taken years to accrue. Everyone’s caught the scent of wealth. Many have followed it to Forbearance. Penta Systems came to New Mexico because office space was cheap and silicon plentiful, and no would-be millionaire would dare start up anywhere else. Communities that trace themselves back to the gold rush days are being displaced as neighborhoods they’ve grown up in suddenly become “hip.”</field>

                  <field name="pitch">At the edges of this world, just beyond the veil, there are colours that few mortals even dream of. Beauty enough to shatter any heart. The Fae live and breathe at the edges of this world. They keep a dusting of that magic tucked behind their ears, just in case. And the Fae are willing to share. They’re nothing if not generous, asking for only one thing in return. A promise. Keep it, and the true beauty of the world will be revealed. Break it, and feel the wrath of faery vengeance.</field>
                  <field name="soc_role">Alluring, otherworldly, fickle, and vengeful. The Fae entices people into making promises, and wields faerie vengeance when those promises are broken. They also have the ability to commune with ethereal forces, just beyond the veil. When you play the Fae, promises matter. Use the Fae’s allure and wit to tease those promises out of other characters. You can add mechanical incentive for others to make promises to you by spending Strings to tempt them to do what you want, or through the move Lure. Keep track of the promises that others make to you, in the margins of your character sheet or on scrap paper.</field>
                  <field name="mech_role">The two stat choices for the Fae allow you to slant toward being either beautiful and mysterious (Hot 2 &amp; Dark 1) or audacious and alien (Volatile 2 &amp; Hot 1). With a consistently-low Cold stat, they aren’t prone to being very chill, cynical, or wry. From their forward sensuality to their unwavering sense of justice, sincerity is a big theme for the Fae. Beyond the Veil, Guide, the option to join a Jury of Fae, and talk of faery justice all invite you to collaboratively imagine the world of faery. To do so, ask questions of the MC, anticipate questions being asked of you in return, and brace yourself for surprise.</field>

                      <field name="pitch">You used to have a future. Growing up was a painful tumult at times, but at least you were growing. Now you only have a past – unfinished business to take care of before you can leave this world behind. Life is precious. You understand that, now that you’ve lost yours. You just want to help. You just want to be seen. But sometimes even the simplest desires feel so difficult to grasp. Ghosty ghost, you’re dead.</field>
                      <field name="soc_role">Lonely, wounded, caring, and creepy. The Ghost has experienced intense trauma, and now seeks validation and intimacy. They have the potential to provide care and healing for others, but also tend to ignore personal and physical boundaries.</field>
                      <field name="mech_role">The two stat choices for the Ghost let you steer toward being either icy and distant (Cold 2 &amp; Dark 1), or scary and moody (Dark 2 &amp; Volatile 1). Your ghost might end up crying out for help, pushing away the very people they care about, or burning themself out trying to take care of others. At the start of the game, the Ghost’s low Hot stat means that they aren’t good at Turning Someone On. This plays into their core dilemma – without social power, how does the Ghost get the attention and emotional support that they need? Maybe they’re endlessly giving, hoping for reciprocation. Helpful Spirit and Transference both point in that direction. Maybe they’re mean and spiteful, assuming from the outset that they aren’t worthy of affection. Unresolved Trauma and Projected Blame provide a different dynamic, suggesting a mean and spiteful Ghost who lashes out at those who remind them of what they’ve lost. Creep and Limitless add a voyeuristic element, encouraging the Ghost to ignore others’ boundaries. Lots of other possibilities exist in the interactions between these moves, too.</field>

                          <field name="pitch">Death changed you. It took away your contemplative joy, it dulled your senses, and it left you impossibly hungry. That hunger is always with you, like a hum in your ears that swells and crescendos until you can’t hear anything else. Unattended, it will come to dominate you – but feeding it may be just as bad. There is a certain beauty to what you’ve become. Your gaunt body, its unnatural form – it draws people in. Your stark disinterest is beguiling. But underneath that disaffected presentation – the hunger, the hunger.</field>
                          <field name="soc_role">Obsessive, dangerous, morbid, and quiet. The Ghoul is constantly contending with voracious Hunger, and the emotional distance brought on by death makes it easier to do bad things in pursuit of feeding. They might be a flesh-eating zombie, or something a little more subtle and strange. Watchful Golem and Esprit de Corpse both present the ability to steer the Ghoul in a couple different directions. Are you watching over others out of a deep-rooted but unexpressed sense of care? Or are you skulking around serving them because death took away your sense of independence?</field>
                          <field name="mech_role">The two stat choices for the Ghoul paint a portrait of the character as either cruel and erratic (Volatile 2 &amp; Cold 1) or disaffected and portentous (Cold 2 &amp; Dark 1). Since The Hunger forces you to Keep Your Cool to avoid a feeding opportunity, your Cold stat plays a pivotal role in maintaining self-control. Short Rest For the Wicked is a recipe for pandemonium. It’s also an invitation to the MC to frame you into a new, dramatic situation. A lot can happen in a few hours. Your Sex Move prompts you to create a new Hunger. It can be anything you like, and it’s added to your character alongside their existing Hungers. If you have sex often, you’ll find your appetite growing wider and weirder all the time.</field>

The seating chart is important for a few reasons: it introduces new characters, it allows you to establish additional relationships, and it draws out the petty high school drama early. The MC is in charge of the seating chart process, but it depends on back-and-forth collaboration. The MC starts by drawing a simple classroom – a teacher’s desk at the front, and several rows of student desks. The ideal is three rows of five, or four rows of four, despite the fact that real high school classrooms typically have double that many desks. Each desk should be a square that you can write a name and details inside, and the squares should be drawn as big as your paper will allow.</field>

You gain Strings on specific individuals, and can then spend them as a sort of currency during interactions with those individuals. Strings can be earned by Turning Someone On, Shutting Someone Down, or in ways specific to each Skin. Strings are abstract, reflecting a general shift in power within a relationship. There is no specific response demanded when someone gains a String, other than playing your character with authenticity as power dynamics are shifting. There is a space to keep track of Strings on the character sheet. The best way to use that space is to list the other characters, and then whenever you gain a String on one of them draw a little circle next to their name. When you spend the String, fill in the circle. Whenever you spend a String, there should be something in the fiction to explain the mechanical effect. If you’re adding 1 to a roll against them, what’s causing that effect? Do you utter some snide remark that throws them off balance? Or if you’re tempting them to do your bidding, how do you use your emotional hold to do that? Do you dangle a juicy secret in return for their obedience, or is it your seductive allure drawing them in? Sometimes it can help to think back to how you got the String in the first place.</field>

Or, the MC can ask questions about those topics, and the player can fill in those details. Or, another player can suggest that they’re there too, and jump in with their character.  The MC has authority over scene framing. This means that the MC is the one who ultimately decides where the next scene starts and what is happening. However, the MC is invited to share that authority and responsibility whenever doing so makes sense. If it’s clear to the MC what the next moment of action or brooding gloom will be, they can dive into that scene. If it isn’t clear, they can ask questions in order to give others an opportunity to introduce interesting situations.</field>

These demands sometimes push characters out of their comfort zones and into the territory of hard decisions. If your character is part of a gang, expect some chaos as a result. One of the jobs of the MC is to give voice to gang members, and to look for situations where they might suddenly get demanding. But your gang can also help you. When they help you carry out a task, add 1 to your relevant rolls. When they join you in an act of violence, they inflict an additional 1 Harm. Remember that the characters in your gang are still individuals under the MC’s authority. Their power, personality, and ambitions aren’t inherently under your control.</field>
