# Assemble

Assemble uses Google's [Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly) library for JavaScript.

Most of the code seen here is from the Blockly library itself.  Functionality unique to Assemble is handled by the files **index.html** and **blocks/system.js**.

Assemble is run by opening **index.html** in a browser (optimized for Chrome).
